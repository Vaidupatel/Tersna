## What is Tersna?

<br>

Tersna is an AI interface layer between  
your knowledge,  
your systems,  
and the people who interact with them.

<br>

Instead of isolated chatbots or rigid workflows,  
Tersna focuses on AI agents that can  
understand context,  
communicate naturally,  
and eventually take action on your behalf.

<br><br>

<br><br>

## Who is Tersna for?

<br>

Tersna is built for founders and teams who want to use AI  
without becoming AI experts.

<br>

It is for organizations with valuable information locked in documents.  
For products that already expose APIs but lack a conversational layer.  
For teams operating across languages and regions.

<br><br>

<br><br>

## What problem does it solve?

<br>

Most organizations already have the answers their users need.  
Those answers live in files, systems, and databases.

<br>

The problem is not intelligence.  
The problem is access.

<br>

Tersna makes your existing knowledge and systems  
usable through natural conversation -  
first through text,  
and then through voice.

<br><br>

<br><br>

## Why is Tersna different?

<br>

Tersna does not treat AI as a black box.

<br>

Your data remains private.  
Your systems stay in control.  
The AI operates within clear boundaries,  
guided by context and intent -  
not generic training data.

<br>

This is not an internet-trained chatbot.  
It is an agent grounded in your reality.

## What happens next?

<br>

Tersna is rolling out in deliberate phases.

<br>

**Phase 1** — Text-based AI assistants (available today)  
**Phase 2** — API-connected actions  
**Phase 3** — Voice-based AI agents

<br>

Each phase builds on the previous one,  
without forcing migration or re-architecture.
